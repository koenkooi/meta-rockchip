# The rockchip kernel for mach-rk3188 does not support out-of-tree build,
# mainly because the Makefile includes relative path to the parent directory
# for most of its dependencies (mach-rk30 and plat-rk). By doing so, it breaks
# the out-of-tree build. Even by patching the Makefile to use "realpath", it is
# very difficult to have a successful build (we get strange link errors). So we
# create symlinks, to put dependencies into the same directory.
